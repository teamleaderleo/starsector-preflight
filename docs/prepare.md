# One-command profile preparation

Prepare every renderer-independent cache and write one validation report:

```bash
java -jar preflight.jar prepare
```

Preflight discovers Starsector, reads the enabled profile, prepares reusable artifacts, validates them, and writes:

```text
~/.starsector-preflight/cache/reports/preparation-latest.json
```

The installation, mods, saves, launcher, and VM parameter files remain unchanged.

## Pipeline

The default command runs:

1. enabled-profile census
2. loose-resource provider index build or artifact reuse
3. resource-index validation
4. persistent JAR/classpath profile build or reuse
5. classpath metadata validation
6. prepared texture build or blob reuse
7. texture-manifest validation
8. one atomic report write

Add semantic lookup verification:

```bash
java -jar preflight.jar prepare --verify-lookups
```

That runs the deterministic baseline-versus-index comparison for both available indexes and fails the preparation result on any provider mismatch.

## Useful options

```bash
java -jar preflight.jar prepare \
  --game "/path/to/Starsector" \
  --cache-dir "/path/to/preflight-cache" \
  --report "/path/to/preparation.json" \
  --workers 4 \
  --memory-mb 256 \
  --deep \
  --verify-lookups \
  --lookup-queries 10000 \
  --seed 42
```

`--deep` rehashes source JARs during classpath validation. The texture memory budget applies to concurrent image decoding, conversion, blob reads, and writes.

Individual stages may be disabled:

```bash
java -jar preflight.jar prepare --no-textures
java -jar preflight.jar prepare --no-classpath
java -jar preflight.jar prepare --no-resource-index --no-textures
```

Texture preparation requires the loose-resource index. Disabling that index causes the texture stage to be reported as skipped rather than silently using an unverified provider set.

## Repeat runs

An unchanged repeat run can report:

- resource index artifact hit after profile rescan and fingerprint comparison
- classpath profile hit after ordered JAR metadata comparison
- prepared texture blob hits without ImageIO decoding
- zero lookup-equivalence mismatches

Changing enabled mod order rebuilds ordered profile artifacts while preserving content-addressed JAR inventories and prepared texture blobs whose source content is unchanged.

## Report

Every stage records:

- `SUCCESS`, `FAILED`, or `SKIPPED`
- duration
- artifact hits and builds
- validation counts and problems
- diagnostics

The report also has a separate readiness section:

- cache artifacts may be prepared and validated;
- the compatibility-v2 vanilla adapter remains under review and is not reported as integrated;
- preparation never enables either texture adapter mode;
- compatibility and prepared-pixel modes still require a reviewed real-install pilot;
- Fast Rendering remains optional;
- launch acceleration is not claimed until a compatible live adapter consumes the artifacts.

This distinction keeps offline preparation useful without overstating runtime integration or activation readiness.
