# Automatic launch and discovery

Preflight is designed to run without editing Starsector or Fast Rendering files.

## Commands

```bash
java -jar preflight.jar doctor
java -jar preflight.jar scan
java -jar preflight.jar prepare
java -jar preflight.jar run
java -jar preflight.jar install
```

`doctor` performs discovery and prints every candidate. `scan` writes a workload census for the enabled mod profile. `prepare` builds and validates reusable caches without launching the game. `run` performs the same census, then launches the selected candidate with trace capture. `install` copies the runnable JAR into the user's Preflight directory and creates a convenient platform launcher.

## Launch relationship

Preflight is an additional wrapper entry point. It does not replace the Starsector launcher and does not patch that launcher on disk.

```text
Starsector Preflight
  -> discovers or receives the existing launcher path
  -> starts that launcher as a child process
  -> adds one process-local JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS value
  -> the existing launcher starts Starsector normally
```

The child may be the vanilla launcher, a Fast Rendering launcher, or another explicitly selected compatible wrapper. Preflight's process-local environment disappears when the child exits.

## Discovery order

Preflight considers:

1. `--launcher`
2. `--game`
3. `STARSECTOR_HOME`
4. `STARSECTOR_DIR`
5. The current directory
6. Common platform locations

macOS candidates include app bundles in `/Applications`, `~/Applications`, and `~/Games`. Linux candidates include common home, games, local-share, and `/opt` directories. Windows candidates include Program Files, Local AppData, and a home Games directory.

Within a game directory, Preflight recognizes common Starsector and Fast Rendering shell scripts, command files, executables, and macOS app-bundle executables. Fast Rendering names receive a higher selection score than vanilla launcher names.

Use an explicit launcher whenever an unusual port or custom wrapper receives the wrong score:

```bash
java -jar preflight.jar run --launcher "/absolute/path/to/custom-launcher"
```

## Enabled mod profile

Preflight locates `mods/enabled_mods.json`, resolves each enabled ID through the installed mods' `mod_info.json`, and scans enabled directories in profile order.

The resulting `profile.json` reports:

- Enabled and missing mod IDs
- Total files and compressed bytes
- Images, sounds, JARs, loose Java source, and data-file totals
- Per-extension and per-mod totals
- Largest mods and assets
- Duplicate logical paths and probable enabled-order winners
- A profile fingerprint for comparing benchmark runs

The duplicate-path result is an early census. The persistent resource index provides the complete ordered provider list and winning provider used by Preflight's current lookup model.

Run only the scan with:

```bash
java -jar preflight.jar scan --game "/path/to/game" --json profile.json
```

Normal launches scan automatically. `run --no-scan` disables it for one launch. Scan failures are reported and the game launch continues.

## Injection model

Preflight passes one additional value to the child process through `JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS`:

```text
-javaagent:/path/to/preflight.jar=dest64=ENCODED_TRACE_PATH
```

The encoded destination avoids parsing problems with spaces and commas. Existing `JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS` content is preserved. A second Preflight agent is rejected to avoid duplicate recordings.

This environment change exists only for the launched child process. Preflight leaves all original launchers and VM parameter files untouched.

### Optional vanilla adapter probe

The adapter is OFF by default. A normal run installs no adapter transformer and writes no `adapter.json`.

```bash
java -jar preflight.jar run --adapter-probe
```

Probe mode installs a read-only class observer. It records candidate class hashes and method signatures while retaining every original class byte. `--adapter` selects the fail-closed enabled mode, which still requires an exact allowlisted target and a registered transformation plan.

See [vanilla runtime adapter](vanilla-adapter.md) for the activation gate, report format, kill switch, and the point where a real Starsector installation is required.

## Run output

Each ordinary profiling run receives a directory containing:

- `run.json` — selected launcher, command, Java version, timestamps, effective and raw launcher exit codes,
  bounded fatal-log lifecycle evidence, and profile report path
- `profile.json` — enabled-mod workload census
- `startup.jfr` — raw Java Flight Recorder data
- `summary.json` — aggregate and attributed startup metrics

Probe or enabled adapter runs additionally write:

- `adapter.json` — observed candidate signatures, allowlist evaluations, transformations, and contained failures

The default location is `~/.starsector-preflight/runs/`.

## Installed launchers

### macOS

`install` creates:

```text
~/Applications/Starsector Preflight.app
```

The wrapper uses the Java runtime that executed the installer and invokes the copied Preflight JAR. The original Starsector app remains unchanged.

### Linux

`install` creates:

```text
~/.local/bin/starsector-preflight
~/.local/share/applications/starsector-preflight.desktop
```

### Windows

`install` creates a command launcher under Local AppData. Desktop and Start Menu shortcut generation can be added after native Windows validation.

## Troubleshooting

Run:

```bash
java -jar preflight.jar doctor --game "/path/to/game"
```

Then use `--launcher` with the exact file shown by the relevant vanilla or Fast Rendering installation. `--dry-run` prints the complete command, selected working directory, trace destination, adapter mode, and injected Java option without starting the game.
