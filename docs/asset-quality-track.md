# Asset Quality Track (exploratory)

Status: **exploratory / not yet evidence-gated.** This document records a proposed
second track distinct from the measured speed-first program in
[optimization-north-star.md](optimization-north-star.md). Nothing here is committed
work or a release claim. It exists so the idea and its concrete asset facts are not
lost, and so the open questions can be researched (including by external tools).

## Framing: two opposite vectors on the same resources

Everything under consideration lands on one of two axes that pull against each other on
VRAM, GPU upload bandwidth, and decode time:

- **Speed track** (the existing program): make assets *cheaper* — pre-decoded textures,
  persisted Janino bytecode, prepared audio, AppCDS, bounded scheduling. Less work and
  less memory pressure at load.
- **Quality track** (this document): make selected assets *richer* — higher-resolution,
  crisper. This *costs* load time, VRAM, and upload.

They can coexist, but only as **separate, independently switchable opt-in modes**, and
the quality track must never silently regress the speed-track measurements. This matches
the project's exact-gated, fail-open discipline: a quality transformation is applied only
when it passes its gate, otherwise the original bytes are used.

Measured repeat-launch CPU attribution (from the north star) sets the guardrail the
quality track must respect: audio decoding ~24–28% and Janino ~25–27% of samples, with
texture preparation the third dominant domain. Any quality feature is validated against
the existing JFR per-subsystem attribution before and after, so a fidelity gain is never
confused with a load-time regression.

## Not frame generation

The relevant technique is **offline single-image super-resolution baked into assets
once**, not runtime temporal frame interpolation. Given fixed model weights and a fixed
input it is deterministic and therefore reproducible and content-addressable — it slots
into `prepare` as a new transformation type alongside the existing `IDENTITY` path, with
its own faithfulness gate. Model cost is paid once, offline; it does not touch the render
loop.

## Sub-proposal A: crisper fonts (best quality-per-risk; candidate standalone mod)

The most-felt, lowest-risk fidelity win, and a clean candidate to also ship as an
isolated drop-in mod. Fonts are UI-space: no gameplay geometry is coupled to them.

### Concrete asset facts (reviewed 0.98a-RC8 install)

- Location: `Contents/Resources/Java/graphics/fonts/` (this is the core resource root on
  macOS; note `stelnet.log` sits at the root of the same tree, which is why runtime logs
  are now excluded from the resource index — see [resource-index.md](resource-index.md)).
- 51 `*.fnt` files, ~2.1 MB total including atlases.
- Format: **AngelCode BMFont, plain ASCII text (CRLF)**. Each font is a pair:
  `name.fnt` + one or more `name_<page>.png` greyscale/alpha atlases.
- Example header (`insignia15LTaa.fnt`):
  ```text
  info face="InsigniaLT" size=15 bold=0 italic=0 ... stretchH=100 smooth=1 aa=4 ...
  common lineHeight=15 base=12 scaleW=256 scaleH=256 pages=1 packed=0 alphaChnl=1 ...
  page id=0 file="insignia15LTaa_0.png"
  char id=32 x=254 y=39 width=1 height=1 xoffset=0 yoffset=12 xadvance=4 page=0 chnl=15
  ```
- Field roles:
  - **Atlas-space (scale with resolution):** `char x, y, width, height`; `common scaleW, scaleH`.
  - **Layout-space (screen px):** `char xoffset, yoffset, xadvance`; `common lineHeight, base`; `info size`.

### The central design question (research this before building)

There are two very different outcomes, and they must not be conflated:

1. **"Bigger text"** — scale *every* number (atlas-space *and* layout-space) by 2×,
   upscale the atlas 2×. Text renders twice as large. Only useful as an accessibility
   option; it changes UI layout and may break fixed-size panels.
2. **"Same size, sharper" (the goal)** — keep layout-space metrics unchanged so text
   occupies the same screen space, but sample glyphs from a higher-resolution atlas so
   each glyph is supersampled/anti-aliased at its native on-screen size.

### Rendering mechanism (resolved)

Static analysis first: the engine's own font renderer is obfuscated (`fs.common_obf.jar`);
`com.fs.starfarer.api.ui.Fonts` is only a name-constants class, and no `LazyFont` string
appears in any shipped jar. I did not reverse-engineer the commercial binary. Instead the
mechanism is settled by the **public `LazyFont` javadoc** (LazyLib), which documents how
these same `.fnt` fonts are drawn:

- Fonts have a native size, `getBaseHeight()`; `createText(text, color, size, …)` scales
  glyphs from the atlas to the requested `size`.
- Quoted: the draw size *"should be evenly divisible by `getBaseHeight()`. Other values may
  cause slight blurriness or jaggedness."*

So the atlas resolution and the on-screen draw size are **decoupled through baseHeight
scaling**. A font whose atlas is rendered at an integer multiple of its draw size is
*downsampled* at draw time → supersampled → crisp. This **resolves the bigger-vs-sharper
question**: the vehicle for same-size sharpness is an `N×` descriptor (baseHeight and all
coordinates ×N) paired with a genuine `N×` atlas, drawn at the original size. A Starsector
developer tweet and the [1440p UI-scale blur thread](https://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=25115.0)
confirm the complement: UI-scale (e.g. 140%) resamples the *whole rendered UI*, so even a
crisp native font softens under global scaling — argue for generating at a scale matched to
the user's UI-scale setting.

**The one load-bearing corollary:** upscaling the *baked* atlas gains nothing — interpolate
up, let the renderer scale down, and you are back to the original quality. A real gain
requires **re-rasterizing glyphs from the vector (TTF) source at N×**, not resampling the
shipped PNG. That in turn raises a licensing constraint (below).

The only residual unknown is whether the **core UI** draws each font at a fixed on-screen
size (so swapping in an `N×` descriptor+atlas at the same requested size yields crispness
directly) or at the font's declared size (which would enlarge text). The custom-font API —
`Global.getSettings().loadFont(path)` plus `setParaFont`/`setTitleFont`/… per the
[wiki.gg custom-fonts guide](https://starsector.wiki.gg/wiki/Using_Other/Custom_Fonts) —
lets a mod load fonts by path, and LazyFont-drawn text clearly honors an arbitrary size;
the core-UI size-selection is the single fact to confirm empirically (protocol below).

### What the community font evidence says (tier-4/5)

A 2024 report describes visible text blur at 140% UI scale; raising multisampling from 0
to 16 did little, and partial relief came only from a lower display resolution or by
selecting a larger existing font in the config. Others call the scaled UI blurry. Three
conclusions follow, and they narrow the design:

- **Launcher UI scaling resamples already-rasterized bitmap-font output** — it upscales
  finished text rather than supersampling the atlas, so a higher-density atlas does not
  automatically get sampled above 1:1 through UI scaling. This makes the naive "2× atlas +
  2× metrics" path unlikely to yield same-size sharpness on its own.
- **MSAA targets rendered geometry, not textured glyph interiors** — it offers little for
  an already-rasterized font atlas. Stop treating it as a font fix.
- **Selecting a larger font** improves readability through bigger glyphs but leaves the
  same-size/high-density problem unsolved.

**Refined recommendation.** Produce an `N×` font: an `N×` descriptor (this is the
`BitmapFont.scaled(N)` transform, landed — see below) paired with a **truly re-rasterized
`N×` atlas** from the vector source, drawn at the original on-screen size so the renderer
supersamples it down. Do **not** ship an upscaled baked atlas — it adds no detail.

**Licensing constraint (shapes the architecture).** The game ships baked atlases, not the
source TTFs, and several faces (Insignia LT, Victor, Futura) are commercially licensed.
Orbitron is OFL/free. So a *redistributable* upscaled-font pack is licensing-constrained,
while re-rasterization needs the vector source. The clean architecture is therefore a
**local generator tool** that ships code, not fonts: it rasterizes at the user's chosen
scale from OFL faces (or fonts the user already has), emitting `{name.fnt, name_<page>.png}`
pairs on their machine. A ready-made pack is only redistributable for OFL faces.

### Font tooling (landed — both halves + CLI)

The full offline `N×` font generator is implemented in `preflight-cli`:

- `BitmapFont` — parses AngelCode `.fnt` text; exposes `baseHeight()`, `charIds()`,
  `pageFiles()`; applies an exact integer `scaled(N)` over every pixel coordinate (`info
  size/padding/spacing/outline`, `common lineHeight/base/scaleW/scaleH`, `char
  x/y/width/height/xoffset/yoffset/xadvance`, `kerning amount`) while leaving ids, channels,
  flags, percentages, and page files untouched. Round-trips the real `insignia15LTaa.fnt`
  (233 glyphs, CRLF).
- `FontAtlasGenerator` — the atlas half: rasterizes a vector `java.awt.Font` into a shelf-
  packed atlas of white glyphs with anti-aliased alpha coverage (the layout Starsector's
  tinting renderer expects), computing exact BMFont metrics (`xoffset`/`yoffset` from the ink
  box relative to the baseline). Verified to pack every glyph inside atlas bounds.
- `preflight font generate` — `--ttf <font.ttf> | --logical sans-serif|serif|monospaced`,
  `--size <px>`, `--name`, `--out-dir`, `[--atlas-width] [--padding] [--charset-from
  <font.fnt> | --ascii | --latin1]`. Writes `<name>.fnt` + `<name>_0.png` and a JSON report.
  `--charset-from` copies an existing font's exact glyph coverage. Ships no fonts: the vector
  source is operator-supplied, keeping licensing with the user.

- `preflight font generate-pack` — batch mode: from one TTF and the game's `graphics/fonts`
  directory, generates a **matched replacement for every `.fnt`** (each at its original
  on-screen size × `--scale`, with its original coverage) and writes a complete drop-in mod
  (`mod_info.json` + `graphics/fonts/*`). One JVM, TTF loaded once — this is the
  bring-your-own-font mod generator.

### In-game results (confirmed 2026-07-24)

A real Starsector 0.98a-RC8 run with generated packs settled the open questions:

- **Mod override of core fonts works.** A mod shipping `graphics/fonts/<name>.fnt` at a core
  path replaces what the core UI renders. (First attempt changed almost nothing because it
  replaced `victor14`; `settings.json` sets `defaultFont = graphics/fonts/insignia15LTaa.fnt`
  — replacing that and the other insignia/orbitron sizes is what moves the UI. Hence
  `generate-pack`, which replaces all ~51 at once.)
- **The core UI renders each font at its declared `.fnt` metrics.** A 2× descriptor makes text
  **bigger**, not same-size-sharper. So LazyFont's baseHeight→draw-size downscaling applies to
  text a mod draws in code (`createText(…, size)`), **not** to the core UI. The N× same-size
  crispness route is therefore code-API-only; for the core UI, an N× pack is a *larger-text*
  (accessibility) option, best at native resolution.
- **Residual graininess is display/UI-scale, not the atlas.** At 100% UI scale a bitmap font
  renders ~1:1, so no atlas beats it; the softness the operator sees comes from running below
  native resolution / UI upscaling (dev-confirmed). The lever there is resolution settings.

Net: the shippable win is a **same-size whole-UI typeface swap** (`generate-pack --scale 1`) —
the bring-your-own-readable-font feature. "Bigger, clearer text" is a real but separate
accessibility option and would want fits-in-layout care (a whole-UI 2× overflows panels).

### Empirical protocol (resolves the residual unknown, license-clean)

Orbitron is OFL, so this needs no commercial font. Generate a 2×-size Orbitron pack matching a
core font's coverage — for example:

```bash
preflight font generate --ttf Orbitron-Regular.ttf --size 40 \
  --name orbitron20 --out-dir override/graphics/fonts \
  --charset-from /path/to/starsector-core/graphics/fonts/orbitron20.fnt
```

Drop it in as a core-font override and compare the same text at the same UI setting.
**Crisper at the same size** ⇒ the mechanism holds and the core UI honors a fixed draw size
(ship it). **Larger text** ⇒ the core UI uses the declared size (fall back to LazyFont-drawn
contexts via the custom-font API, or to a UI-scale-matched native re-rasterization).

### Font test matrix

```text
Display resolution:  native | one lower supported resolution
UI scale:            100% | 140% | 200%
Font source:         original atlas
                     hinted native-size atlas
                     offline-supersampled/downsampled native atlas
                     larger existing Starsector font
                     experimental 2x atlas with proportional metric changes
```

Capture lossless crops of identical text and measure: physical glyph height (screen px),
edge-spread width, local contrast, baseline position, character advance, fractional-position
blur, atlas bleed, clipping.

### Delivery options

- **Local generator tool (preferred; license-clean):** ship the generator, not the fonts.
  It re-rasterizes an `N×` atlas from an OFL face (or one the user supplies) and pairs it
  with `BitmapFont.scaled(N)`, writing `{name.fnt, name_<page>.png}` on the user's machine.
  Sidesteps redistribution of commercial faces entirely.
- **Standalone Starsector mod (only for OFL faces):** ship replacement pairs that override
  `graphics/fonts/*` — clean for Orbitron and any OFL substitute, not for Insignia LT /
  Victor / Futura. Verify a mod can shadow *core* font paths by load order (the project's
  winning-provider logic shows later roots win; confirm vanilla Starsector resolves core
  font resources the same way).
- **Folded into preflight:** a font atlas is a texture through the existing `TextureLoader`
  hook and the `.fnt` is an indexed resource, so the cache could serve enhanced pairs under
  the same exact/faithfulness gate — subject to the same licensing boundary.

## Sub-proposal B: texture super-resolution (broader, higher risk)

Offline SR as a new `Transformation` type, opt-in, deterministic, cached like prepared
textures.

- **Faithfulness gate (in the project's spirit):** round-trip check — downscale the
  upscaled result back to native and compare to the source; if it drifts past a
  threshold, reject and retain original bytes. A *faithfulness* budget instead of a
  *byte-identity* budget.
- **Model spectrum:** classical scalers (xBRZ/Super-xBR/scaleFX) are deterministic but
  tuned for pixel art and look waxy on Starsector's painterly sprites; ML models
  (Real-ESRGAN and kin) suit painterly art and are still reproducible (fixed weights, no
  seed) but can hallucinate — favor conservative settings + the round-trip gate.
- **Load-bearing gotcha — verify first:** ship/weapon sprites have gameplay-coupled pixel
  geometry (bounds points, weapon-mount coordinates, render scale defined relative to
  native sprite pixels in `.ship`/`.variant` data). Naive rescaling can change world
  render size or desync mounts/bounds. **Safe targets:** fonts, UI chrome, backgrounds,
  planet/star/nebula sprites, effect fringes. **Unsafe without display-size handling:**
  hulls and weapons.

### VRAM cost is first-class — the Asset Lab enforces a budget

A quality overlay improves fidelity while increasing launch work, heap pressure, upload
traffic, and VRAM. Because combat-only slowdown often traces to VRAM exhaustion (see
[community-evidence.md](community-evidence.md)), the cost must be estimated up front, not
discovered in a battle. Add a decoded-texture / VRAM estimator to `doctor` and profile
reports, built from the resource census:

```text
Decoded texture bytes:  RGB = w × h × 3      RGBA = w × h × 4
Additional allocations: mip levels, normal/material/surface maps, generated effect
                        textures, framebuffer attachments, temporary upload buffers
Enhancement multiplier: 2× width&height = 4× pixels    4× width&height = 16× pixels
```

Report the pixel multiplier prominently for any enhancement, and generate estimates for:
current profile; proposed enhanced overlay; current + overlay; common UI/campaign working
set; representative combat working set; GraphicsLib-associated maps; and the largest
individual texture allocations.

- The **Asset Lab** (offline, opt-in overlay generator) must **reject or warn** on outputs
  exceeding a configurable memory budget.
- Enhanced assets live in a **separate cache namespace and manifest** from the speed-track
  prepared textures, so a fidelity overlay can never silently enter a speed measurement.

**Implemented (core + prepare report).** `TextureMemoryEstimator` /
`TextureMemoryEstimate` (in `preflight-core`) compute the exact base decoded bytes, RGB/RGBA
counts, largest allocations, the full-mip-chain upper bound, the 2×/4× enhancement
projections (overlay-only and combined-if-both-resident), and a `exceedsBudget(long)` check —
pure arithmetic over the texture manifest, no game launch. `prepare` emits this under
`.stages.textures.details.memoryEstimate`, and `texture manifest inspect <manifest.spfm>`
prints it for any existing manifest without re-running preparation. Still to do: feed the
census image/working-set breakdowns (UI/campaign/combat/GraphicsLib maps) and wire the
budget verdict into the future Asset Lab.

## Explicitly out of scope: in-game FPS

Big-battle slowdown is a largely **single-threaded CPU bottleneck** (combat sim,
projectile physics, AI scripts). This project is deliberately non-invasive to the game's
sim/render loop, and pre-decoded textures are already resident in VRAM by then, so they do
not help steady-state FPS. The only adjacent, honest win is the *opposite* of upscaling:
texture **compression / shrinking oversized mod textures** to reduce VRAM thrashing and
its stutter on low-VRAM machines — a frametime-stability lever, not a raw-FPS one, and one
that trades against Sub-proposal B. A July 2026 community case (smooth campaign, severe
combat slowdown, resolved by cutting VRAM demand and GraphicsLib settings) corroborates
this, though it remains a single recent report — see [community-evidence.md](community-evidence.md).

## Audio quality: deprioritized

Audio super-resolution (bandwidth extension) mostly hallucinates high frequencies onto
source that is already at an adequate sample rate — low ROI, easy to worsen. The audio
subsystem's measured value is decode/load **speed** (~24–28% of samples); keep it there.

## Suggested next steps (measurement-first, matching project culture)

1. Confirm where a heavy-profile load actually spends time using the existing JFR
   attribution, so any quality feature is judged against real per-subsystem numbers.
2. Prototype the font atlas at 2× on a single font, resolve the bigger-vs-sharper
   question empirically, and test core-font shadowing by a standalone mod.
3. Only then consider Sub-proposal B, starting with backgrounds/planets behind a
   round-trip faithfulness gate — never hulls/weapons first.
