# Roadmap

Preflight follows a measurement-first sequence. Each optimization keeps the original loader available as a fallback.

## Current near-term program

The July 2026 unified real-install runs completed the broad discovery gate for texture loading, Janino compilation, and audio decoding.

- [Optimization North Star](optimization-north-star.md) records the real-install evidence, exact reviewed targets, ordered implementation program, benchmark protocol, and release gates.
- [Real texture preparation and compatibility pilot](evidence/2026-07-18-real-texture-preparation-and-compatibility-pilot.md) records the passing full-profile preparation, the title-screen renderer failure, and the bounded launcher-lifecycle reporting fix.
- [Compatibility-v2 acceptance evidence](evidence/2026-07-19-real-texture-compatibility-v2-acceptance.md) records one bounded accepted real-install texture run.
- [Prepared-pixel operator and LLM handoff](prepared-pixels-operator-handoff.md) defines the exact current sequence and stop points.
- [Next LLM Implementation Handoff](next-llm-handoff.md) provides current identities, responsibilities, prohibited shortcuts, and the next implementation decision tree.

The adapter-OFF control reached the main screen and exited normally. Compatibility-v2 preserves Starsector's asynchronous image-preloader handoff, matches the exact installed bytes, and passed bounded real-install behavioral acceptance on 2026-07-19. PR #117 repaired the installed-style prepared-pixel color flow, and PR #119 added an offline exact installed-class contract checker. The immediate sequence is now: run that checker against the reviewed installation, review the report, complete one prepared-pixel lifecycle through campaign/combat/save/clean exit, and only then run repeated OFF-versus-compatibility-versus-prepared-pixel measurements. Audio and Janino remain exact-evidence gated until the texture decision is made.

## M0: Measurement foundation

- Launch-time JFR agent
- Startup trace summarizer
- Repeatable benchmark protocol
- Profile and environment fingerprints

Exit condition: a baseline result bundle explains the dominant startup costs for at least one large mod profile.

## M1: Resource index

- Ordered enabled-mod fingerprint
- Winning-provider lookup
- All-provider lookup for mergeable resources
- Negative lookup cache
- Case-collision diagnostics

Exit condition: fixture tests match reference resource resolution and benchmarks show the saved lookup work.

## M2: Prepared textures

- Benchmark current decode and conversion path
- Bulk conversion for common image layouts
- Versioned prepared-texture payload
- Content-addressed cache pack
- Corruption detection and rebuilding
- Exact-gated compatibility and upload-ready runtime consumers

Exit condition: cached and uncached texture data are equivalent and repeat startup improves on image-heavy profiles.

## M3: Script bytecode

- Measure loose-source compilation cost
- Persist generated and transformed bytecode
- Capture complete ordered source/resource dependencies
- Conservative exact-context invalidation

Exit condition: representative source-heavy profiles compile once and safely reuse complete generated class maps.

## M4: Scheduling and integration

- Separate image and script worker pools
- In-flight decoded-byte budget
- Runtime adapter for vanilla Starsector and optional Fast Rendering support
- Cross-platform packaging and diagnostics

## M5: Prepared audio and later experiments

- Prove installed-JOrbis PCM and wrapper-contract equivalence
- Reuse short fully decoded effects with exact keys and untouched fallback
- Preserve streaming music until its policy is proven safe
- Evaluate selective lazy loading only when traces identify a narrow safe target

Exit condition: prepared audio is byte-for-byte and metadata-equivalent, bounded, fail-open, and measurably reduces repeat-launch decoding work.

## Exploratory tracks (not yet evidence-gated)

Separate from the speed-first milestone program above:

- [Asset Quality Track](asset-quality-track.md) — proposed opt-in visual-fidelity track
  (crisper BMFont atlases as a candidate standalone mod; offline texture super-resolution
  behind a faithfulness gate). Records concrete font-asset facts, the bigger-vs-sharper
  design question, the gameplay-coordinate gotcha for hull sprites, the VRAM estimator /
  Asset Lab budget, why in-game FPS is out of scope, and external references. Must not
  regress speed-track measurements.
- [Community Evidence and Benchmark Additions](community-evidence.md) — Reddit/forum sweep
  (tier-4/5) that justifies keeping the identity-heavy benchmark design and adds two
  concrete items: a VRAM/decoded-texture estimator and separate runtime/launcher campaign
  orchestration (vanilla+bundled-Java, vanilla+alternate-Java, FR — each OFF and warm).

### Revised near-term priorities (speed track first, quality track opt-in)

1. Complete the prepared-texture lifecycle and controlled timing campaign.
2. Benchmark Starsector's built-in script cache against Preflight Scripts.
3. Run separate bundled-Java, alternate-Java, and FR campaigns (identities never merged).
4. Add VRAM and decoded-texture estimates to `doctor` and profile reports.
   *(In progress: `TextureMemoryEstimator` core + tests landed; `prepare` emits
   `.stages.textures.details.memoryEstimate` and `texture manifest inspect` prints it.
   Census working-set breakdowns landed: `ImageHeaderReader` (exact PNG/JPEG dimensions,
   header-only) feeds a per-mod decoded-VRAM breakdown in `scan` — `decodedWorkingSet`,
   per-mod `decodedImageBytes`, and `largestDecodedMods`. On a real ~70-mod profile this
   surfaced a 4.7 GB decoded floor from 1.1 GB on disk, and a decoded ranking that inverts
   the on-disk one (e.g. a 47 MB mod = 986 MB VRAM). Remaining: Asset Lab budget verdict.)*
5. Add save/load and clean-exit outcomes to launcher-compatibility campaigns.
6. Font quality: **mechanism confirmed in-game** — mod override of core fonts works, and the
   core UI renders at declared `.fnt` metrics (so an `N×` pack is *bigger* text, not
   same-size-sharper; residual graininess is display/UI-scale). **Landed**: `BitmapFont` codec,
   `FontAtlasGenerator` (AWT rasterizer), `preflight font generate`, and `font generate-pack`
   (whole-UI bring-your-own-font mod generator). Remaining: polish the readable-font mod
   (font picker / packaging), optional kerning, and a fits-in-layout larger-text option.
7. Build the texture Asset Lab as an offline, opt-in overlay generator with a budget gate.
8. Keep enhanced assets in a separate cache namespace and manifest.
9. Turn community reports into regression cases.
10. Reserve performance claims for repeatable runs with exact identities.

## Milestone numbering in the issue tracker

M0–M5 above are the original document milestones. Later work continued the numbering in the issue tracker rather than here:

- M6 — synthetic production-cache workload proofs (PRs #67–#68).
- M7 — self-contained real-install probe kits (PR #72).
- M8 — exact real-install identity and equivalence gates before live reuse: issues #75 (audio), #77 (Janino), #78 (texture shape).
- M9 — one exact-profile pre-launch build and launch context: issue #76.
- M10 — repeated real OFF-versus-ENABLED startup benchmarks: issue #80.
