# Prepared-pixel main-menu comparison pilot failure

Date: 2026-07-23

## Result

The first automatic two-run main-menu comparison did not produce a valid A/B result.

## Prepared half

The prepared half ran first and reached the main menu normally:

```text
outcome: COMPLETED
exitCode: 0
launcherExitCode: 0
fatalDetected: false
launcherReadyMs: 9788.513
gameLogStartToMainMenuMs: 85060.434
operatorAccepted: true
automatedAccepted: true
```

Prepared-pixel telemetry remained clean:

```text
prepared hits: 4956
coherent-direct NPOT hits: 4413
fallbacks: 0
internal errors: 0
active direct bytes at shutdown: 0
active/pending buffers at shutdown: 0
```

The full log classification for this half was:

```text
normalMapBufferFailures: 25
graphicsLibErrors: 25
graphicsLibWarnings: 45
musicSourceWarnings: 1
shaderCreationErrors: 0
```

Those counts have no compatibility counterpart because the second half failed before the main menu.

## Compatibility half

The compatibility half ran second. Its launcher reached the automatic marker, but Starsector terminated while loading the core mission `afistfulofcredits`:

```text
outcome: FATAL_LOG_EVIDENCE
exitCode: 6
launcherExitCode: 0
textureAdapterMode: COMPATIBILITY
transformationsApplied: 0
```

Fatal evidence:

```text
Error loading [data/missions/afistfulofcredits/descriptor.json] resource, not found in [...]
```

The corresponding mission-list line was:

```text
Loading mission [afistfulofcredits] ... (source: [null/data/missions/mission_list.csv])
```

The same `source: [null/data/missions/mission_list.csv]` representation appeared during the successful prepared half, where the descriptor loaded. It is therefore not sufficient to explain the failure by itself.

The dialog's long bracketed list is Starsector's resource-search path. The first listed mod directories, including AI Tweaks and Arma Armatura, are not evidence that those mods caused the missing core descriptor.

The archive showed no meaningful working-directory or classpath difference between the two halves beyond the intended texture mode and coherent-direct property. Exact causality for the resource-resolution failure remains unproven.

## Invalid profile comparison

The comparison profile changed between halves.

Initial preparation and the prepared run used:

```text
profileFingerprint: ccbc7f1aebf89c7ed8f21c886ac6a869b496fa3edd36b8943d1269cacd1a8ebe
```

The compatibility run started with:

```text
profileFingerprint: 3c1fc13ee4b47a93d36122ee2804070dbacf43523a3d38df5cc531e35e4513fe
```

The only census delta was `shaderLib` / `zz GraphicsLib-1.12.1`:

```text
files: +2
imageFiles: +2
bytes: +136
imageBytes: +136
```

The prepared log recorded two runtime-generated normal maps matching that delta:

```text
cache/sotf_wisp_lesser___SHIP_normal.png
cache/tpc_weaver___TURRET0_normal.png
```

Therefore the two halves did not run against an identical enabled-profile fingerprint. The pair is invalid independently of the compatibility fatal.

## Launcher-settling observation

The prepared launcher emitted its final reviewed texture marker and then remained open for roughly fourteen seconds before game log activity began.

The compatibility half began game loading roughly three to four seconds after its final launcher marker. The merged detector used only a 1.5-second launcher quiet confirmation. This does not prove that early clicking caused the resource-resolution failure, but it is an order-sensitive difference that the replacement harness must remove.

## Operator note: reproduces on the base launcher (2026-07-24)

The same `Error loading [...] resource, not found in [...]` fatal was reproduced by hand on the plain vanilla launcher with the full mod set and **no preflight involved**, by quitting mid-load and relaunching within a couple of seconds. On the reproduced run the printed resource-search path was complete (all enabled mods present, ending `../starfarer.res/res,CLASSPATH`) and the "missing" file was present and unmodified on disk; a second later victim was a mod mission (`data/missions/armaa_test/mission_text.txt`), not the core one. This looks like a Starsector-side startup ordering artifact on fast relaunch, not a preflight or texture-adapter defect, and is treated as unavoidable and not worth chasing into obfuscated code. It is noted only so the "causality unproven" statement above is not later misread as suspicion of the adapter.

Corollary for repair item 5 below: because the file is present and byte-identical in these failures, a disk-state guard (`.is_file()` + hashing, as in `scripts/starsector_core_resource_guard.py`) cannot detect this class of failure. It is a runtime-resolution failure, not a missing/changed file.

## Required repair

Before one replacement comparison is authorized, the runner must:

1. use a fixed six-second launcher quiet/safety confirmation while retaining the marker timestamp as the measured endpoint;
2. capture the preparation profile fingerprint;
3. rerun deep preparation before and after each half;
4. abort and retain exact mod deltas if the enabled profile changes;
5. verify the core mission list and `afistfulofcredits` descriptor remain present and byte-identical;
6. retain compatibility as the rollback and preserve the single-pair/preliminary boundary.

A replacement run may proceed only after that repair is reviewed, validated, and merged. Do not disable or blame individual mods based on this archive, and do not rerun the old harness.
