# Prepared texture blobs

Preflight Textures converts an encoded image into the exact byte layout consumed by the current texture conversion path, then stores that result in a versioned cache blob.

The literal reference implementation remains the compatibility authority. Production cache generation uses a row-bulk converter only after proving complete `PreparedTexture` equality against that reference path.

## Commands

Prepare one image:

```bash
java -jar preflight.jar texture prepare graphics/ships/example.png
```

The default content-addressed output is:

```text
~/.starsector-preflight/textures/SOURCE_SHA256-identity.spft
```

Choose an explicit output:

```bash
java -jar preflight.jar texture prepare example.png --output example.spft
```

Inspect and verify:

```bash
java -jar preflight.jar texture inspect example.spft
java -jar preflight.jar texture verify example.png example.spft
```

`verify` hashes the current source, performs a fresh literal reference conversion, and compares the complete prepared result with the blob. It does not reuse the optimized preparation path.

Compare literal conversion, bulk-row conversion, and blob reads:

```bash
java -jar preflight.jar texture benchmark example.png example.spft --runs 10
```

The benchmark performs untimed validation passes, alternates literal and bulk measurement order, reports every sample plus minimum, median, mean, and maximum, and keeps blob reads separate. CI checks correctness rather than enforcing timing ratios.

Build a profile-wide cache from an existing or discovered resource index:

```bash
java -jar preflight.jar texture build --game "/path/to/Starsector.app"
java -jar preflight.jar texture build --index profile.spfi --cache-dir cache
```

### Deterministic subset builds

For profiling and staged rollouts, pass a newline-delimited list of logical resource paths:

```bash
java -jar preflight.jar texture build \
  --game "/path/to/Starsector.app" \
  --cache-dir cache \
  --paths-file startup-images.txt
```

The selection file accepts blank lines and `#` comments. Every other line must be a relative logical resource path such as:

```text
graphics/ships/example.png
graphics/icons/example.jpg
cache/generated_normal.png
```

Subset preparation:

- normalizes, lowercases, deduplicates, and sorts paths with the same resource-index rules;
- rejects absolute and traversal paths;
- reports missing and non-image paths without discarding valid selections;
- derives a deterministic subset fingerprint from the full-profile fingerprint and selected winning paths;
- writes a matching subset `.spfi` index and `.spfm` manifest;
- reuses the same content-addressed blob store as full builds;
- never overwrites the full-profile index or manifest.

The JSON command result reports `sourceIndex`, the active subset `index`, the subset `manifest`, selection counts, and diagnostics. A runtime adapter must use the reported subset index and subset manifest together.

## Prepared payload

A prepared texture contains:

- source SHA-256;
- transformation identifier;
- original image dimensions;
- stored payload dimensions;
- three or four channels;
- bottom-up RGB or RGBA conversion bytes;
- three packed `RRGGBBAA` color values used by the loader.

The raw pixel payload remains uncompressed in version 1. This creates a clean baseline for LZ4, low-level Zstandard, pack-file, and memory-mapping experiments.

## Literal reference behavior

The reference converter mirrors the current loader conversion loop:

- decode through Java ImageIO;
- read pixels through `Raster.getPixel`;
- traverse source rows from bottom to top;
- store RGB for opaque images and RGBA for alpha images;
- leave fully transparent output texels zeroed;
- exclude fully transparent texels from color statistics;
- preserve float accumulation order, histograms, and derived-color calculations exactly.

Literal raster behavior is preserved for grayscale and indexed-color images. This can differ from palette-expanded RGB expectations and gives optimized implementations a precise compatibility target.

`ALPHA_ADDER` is represented in the format and intentionally unsupported until its exact transformation is captured in an equivalence fixture.

## Bulk-row conversion

The optimized converter calls `Raster.getPixels()` once per source row instead of `Raster.getPixel()` once per pixel. It then executes the same ordered per-pixel arithmetic as the reference implementation.

It preserves:

- source-row reversal and output byte order;
- raw raster band indexing, including grayscale and indexed-alpha quirks;
- persistent missing-band zero behavior;
- transparent-texel zeroing and exclusion from statistics;
- float sums and histogram update order;
- all three derived loader colors;
- source SHA-256 and binary blob bytes.

Translated subimage rasters are accepted when their bounds contain the image's logical `0..width` and `0..height` rectangle. Unsupported or unusual raster layouts fall back to the literal reference converter.

The equivalence suite covers every standard JDK `BufferedImage` type, premultiplied alpha, BGR/ABGR layouts, ushort RGB and grayscale, binary/indexed images, custom grayscale-plus-alpha and indexed-alpha models, odd dimensions, transparent pixels, translated subimages, and file-backed PNG/JPEG decoding. Deterministic randomized fixtures compare the complete immutable `PreparedTexture` value.

Profile-wide cache generation and `texture prepare` use the bulk-row path. `texture verify` always uses the literal reference path.

## Blob format

Version 1 uses:

```text
magic:      SPFT
version:    32-bit integer
length:     32-bit payload length
payload:    metadata plus raw pixels
checksum:   SHA-256 of the payload
```

The writer uses a sibling temporary file and atomic replacement where supported. The reader validates size bounds, payload length, checksum, transformation, codec, dimensions, channel count, expected pixel length, and trailing data before constructing the texture.

## Runtime consumers

Both live consumers use the exact-reviewed `TextureLoader` class, archive, method, source, and loader identity. A launch selects one mode:

- `compatibility` reconstructs a `BufferedImage` at the private decoded-image seam. Starsector retains its original pixel conversion, OpenGL upload, cleanup, and texture lifetime.
- `prepared-pixels` carries a verified SPFT payload to the lower `BufferedImage -> ByteBuffer` seam. For currently supported power-of-two payloads, a hit supplies the stored bottom-up bytes and all three stored derived colors, bypassing ImageIO decode, raster traversal, vertical reversal, RGB/RGBA conversion, transparent-texel normalization, and color calculation. Starsector retains its original texture allocation, OpenGL call, cleanup, flags, filtering, mipmaps, and texture lifetime.

Both version-2 plans preserve the original `com.fs.graphics.L.class(String)` asynchronous preloader handoff before any Preflight lookup. A preloaded image always wins. Preflight is consulted only on the original direct-decode branch after that handoff returns `null`; an absent or ambiguous handoff leaves the class untouched.

Compatibility mode may use `run --adapter --texture-auto` to resolve the already-prepared manifest and index for the exact current installed profile. This convenience mode remains explicit and read-only; it does not support `prepared-pixels` and fails before launch when the cache is absent or stale.

Prepared-pixels-v2 supports two reviewed color-sink models:

- three direct non-static `java.awt.Color` fields on the texture object; or
- three non-static `TextureLoader` color fields that each flow through an instance method into one distinct, exactly typed texture-object setter.

Mixed, incomplete, ambiguous, untyped, static-transfer, or raster-free models decline. The exact installed archive must pass the offline contract checker before any real prepared-pixel evidence run.

Run the offline check against an extracted class or the containing JAR:

```bash
java -cp preflight-cli/target/preflight.jar \
  dev.starsector.preflight.agent.PreparedPixelContractCheck \
  "/path/to/Starsector.app/Contents/Resources/Java/fs.common_obf.jar"
```

Review [Prepared-pixel acceptance: operator and LLM handoff](prepared-pixels-operator-handoff.md) before constructing any live command.

Every lookup verifies the current winning source SHA-256, manifest/index fingerprint, blob checksum, source identity, transformation, dimensions, channels, and pixel length. SPFT version 1 accepts identity textures whose stored dimensions match their source dimensions. `ALPHA_ADDER`, unexpected pre-padded blobs, oversized payloads, stale indexes, absent entries, changed sources, corrupt blobs, direct-memory pressure, and bridge failures execute the retained original direct-decode and conversion paths once.

## Current NPOT decision

The first installed prepared-pixel pilot proved that Starsector's NPOT upload requires a next-power-of-two-sized buffer. A later implementation guessed a lower-left, row-padded, zero-filled arrangement. That implementation prevented the buffer-length crash but produced incorrect launcher visuals.

The visual failure disproves that guessed arrangement. It does not establish upper placement, reversed row order, contiguous pixels followed by padding, edge replication, or any other alternative.

PR #135 therefore restores fail-open behavior for NPOT textures:

- the prepared lookup may return a lightweight carrier;
- the lower bridge declines NPOT direct-buffer creation;
- Starsector's original decode and conversion execute once;
- the original buffer continues unchanged to Starsector's upload and cleanup;
- bounded telemetry compares the original buffer against fixed candidate layouts without retaining its payload bytes.

Power-of-two prepared hits remain available. During the NPOT layout probe, telemetry records `npotProbeFallbacks`, bounded `originalLayoutObservations`, and `layoutObservationErrors`. `paddedUploads` and `paddingBytes` remain zero because no guessed NPOT buffer is supplied.

Prepared direct-buffer ownership remains bounded to 32 MiB per texture, 64 MiB active bytes, and 1,024 active buffers. The existing Starsector cleanup method always runs. Preflight releases its identity-tracked accounting after original cleanup, including exceptional caller paths.

Prepared pixels remain behaviorally failed after the 2026-07-22 visual result. Compatibility mode remains the accepted rollback path. After PR #135 is reviewed and merged, only one launcher-only original-layout probe may be authorized; gameplay lifecycle runs, repeated benchmarks, and acceleration claims remain blocked until its evidence is reviewed.
